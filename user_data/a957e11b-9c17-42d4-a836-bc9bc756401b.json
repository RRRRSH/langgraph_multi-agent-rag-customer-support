You mentioned wanting to \"order a Flight AA100,\" but then provided details about a flight that appears to be scheduled information.\n\nLet me help clarify your request:\n\n1. Are you trying to **book** a new flight on American Airlines AA100 from LAX to JFK on August 27, 2025?\n2. Are you asking about the **status** of an existing AA100 flight booking?\n3. Or did you mean something else entirely?\n\nAlso, I should mention that based on your current bookings in our system, you have a United Airlines flight (UA500) from JFK to SFO on September 2, 2025, but no American Airlines bookings are showing.\n\nCould you please clarify what you'd like to do with flight AA100?"
